# Augmented Score-CAM: High resolution visual interpretations for deep neural networks

We develop a novel post-hoc visual explanation method called Augmented Score-CAM that improves Score-CAM activation maps by applying image augmentation based on the matrix computation techniques [[1]](#1). In our experiments, we denote our model as ASC and Score-CAM as SSC.
